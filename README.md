<br><br>

  - **`As a visiting user, I would like to play something with words.`** 
    - The game will have two different categories with words and will randomly chose a word for every game.

  - **`As a visiting user, I want to be encouraged to learn something new.`**
    -  The hint area is intended to give the user help on the way to being able to guess the word. Hints are also a way to teach the user something about the word that helps to remember something about the word until the next time it appears.

### Fixed bugs 
 - One bug where found and fixed.
    - When guesses left is at 0 the game is supposed to end, however the bug did allowed the user to make 1 more guess.
    This was fixed with rearranging a if statement. The new if statement will check guesses left after it has decresed the guessing count.
 
### Unfixed bugs
 - If a user is doing a blank space in the input field when guessing a word the code logic will not be able to handle that today and will se it as the wrong answer eaven if the word guessed is right.
